Do not run with sudo.

You have to run the installation twice (omz install will interrupt the process).

- ./install-deb for Ubuntu / Debian based distros;
- ./install-rpm for centos / rocky / fedora-based distros;

Add `--cn` during installation if you are behind the wall.

Other scripts for installing individual tools can be find in ./tools directory.
